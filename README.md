# plugin_dynamicurl: Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA)

This is the repository for the plugin_dynamicurl plugin. This plugin enhances the allowing full freedom inn content URLs, including the following capabilities:

* Give full control to content URLs
* No longer need for the ID in the URL
* 404 pages no longer redirect to a different page

_Note: This is a POC project, so it is not finished and will not work for every project out of the box. It is simply a starting point._

# Demo
TO DO

# Cartridge Path Considerations
The plugin_dynamicurl plugin requires the app\_storefront\_base cartridge. In your cartridge path, include the cartridges in the following order:

```
plugin_dynamicurl:app_storefront_base
```

The cartridge bm_dynamicurl_sitemap needs to be assigned to the business manager site. In your cartridge path, include the cartridges in the following order:

```
bm_dynamicurl_sitemap:bm_app_storefront_base
```


# Custom Object
This solution makes use of a Custom Object Type called "DynamicUrl". Import this in the business manager.

1. Upload file ```metadata/dynamic-url-object.xml``` in Admin > Site Development > Import & Export > Upload
2. Import the file using Meta Data
3. Create a new Dynamic URL by going to "Merchant Tools" > "Custom Objects" > "Custom Object Editor"
4. Select the type "DynamicUrl"
5. Click "New"
6. Fill in the desired path in the "Path" field (e.g. /my-desired-url)
7. Select the type of content (currently type doesn't matter)
8. Fill in the ID of the Content Asset or the Page Designer Page ID in the Content ID field
9. Try it out!

# Job
A sample job has been included in the metadata folder called ```metadata/dynamic-url-jobs.xml```. This can be imported through the business manager.
